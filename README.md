## Commands and what they do
This information is copypasted from $gfhelp. Please refer to that for the most up to date help.
Assuming that that the default prefix $gf is still being used:
### $gfsearch: Search T-Dolls
Search a T-Doll. Returns various information about the doll if it finds it. Returns the closest result if it doesn't find an exact match.

This command supports MOD 3 dolls (among other little easter eggs).
### $gfequip: Search equipment and fairies
Search for equipment or fairies. If you search a doll's name, it will return the exclusive equipment for that doll.

### $gfimage: Display the images and costumes of a T-Doll
Supports listing all the costumes of a T-Doll with --list or -l.

### $gftimer: Check which dolls or equipment correspond to which production timer.
### $gfhelp: List commands, version, how to contact me, etc.
### $gfquote: Show quotes from the dolls if you have CharacterVoice.json from the game files
### $gfstatus: Number of servers this bot is in.
### $gf

You can get more up to date command information by asking the discord bot or opening main.py and scrolling down to the help command. This is just a short summary.

## Prerequesites
Python3 and pip. Game files need to be extracted if you want images and quotes.

To extract files: https://github.com/36base/girlsfrontline-resources-extract

## Setup
**This bot was written for a very old version of Discord.py, if you have a newer version it will need to be replaced or you need multiple python environments.**
1. `git clone https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/Girls-Frontline-Discord-Search.git`
2. Set the GFBOT_TOKEN environment variable in your terminal with the token for the bot
3. Open main.py, change COMMAND_PREFIX to whatever you want, the default is $gf
4. If you have your own http server containing the dumped girls frontline images change PIC_DOMAIN, otherwise you can keep using mine.
5. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (Windows users, the command might be 'pip' instead of pip3)
6. `chmod +x run_forever.sh` (Windows users, you're on your own)
7. `./run_forever.sh` if linux, otherwise `python3 main.py`.
