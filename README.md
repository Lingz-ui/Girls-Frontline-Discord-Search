Features:

- placebo recipies and estimated drop rates for rare dolls.
- Embed color matches star color
- Links to the corresponding doll page on https://en.gfwiki.com

- Images for almost every doll... Assuming you ripped the images from the game files.
- Fire react on a doll's image to show their damage art.
- Aliases. Ex. HKM4 -> HK416
- Fuzzy search that will return the closest result and suggest other results.

Coming eventually:

- $gffilter for finding the best doll in a type.
- $gfsearch flags for only showing the relevant part of an embed.

## Commands
Assuming that that the default prefix $gf is still being used:
- $gfsearch: Search a doll
- $gfimage: Display only the image for that doll.
- $gftimer: Check which dolls correspond to which production timer.
- $gfhelp: List commands, version, how to contact me, etc.
- $gfquote: Show quotes from the dolls if you have CharacterVoice.json from the game files
- $gfstatus: Number of servers this bot is in.

## Prerequesites
Python3 and pip. Game files need to be extracted if you want images and quotes.

To extract files: https://github.com/36base/girlsfrontline-resources-extract

## Setup
**This bot was written for a very old version of Discord.py, if you have a newer version it will need to be replaced or you need multiple python environments.**
1. `git clone https://github.com/RhythmLunatic/Girls-Frontline-Discord-Search.git`
2. Set the GFBOT_TOKEN environment variable in your terminal with the token for the bot
3. Open main.py, change COMMAND_PREFIX to whatever you want, the default is $gf
4. If you have your own http server containing the dumped girls frontline images change PIC_DOMAIN, otherwise you can keep using mine.
5. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (Windows users, the command might be 'pip' instead of pip3)
6. `chmod +x run_forever.sh` (Windows users, you're on your own)
7. `./run_forever.sh` if linux, otherwise `python3 main.py`.
